<h1 align="center"> Smart Contract :- with Attendance for Food, Clothes, Funds, and Other Items :--</h1>

- This is a smart contract for a vendor to provide food, clothes, funds, and other items to attendees.
- The smart contract uses blockchain technology to create a decentralized system that allows for secure and transparent transactions between the vendor and the attendees.

<h1 align="center">Getting Started:--</h1>

<h3 align="center">Prerequisites:--</h3>

<p align="center">Before you begin, you will need the following:--</p>

- A blockchain platform like Ethereum or EOS.

- An IDE like Remix or Truffle.

- A web3 provider like MetaMask.

<h1 align="center">Installation:--</h1>

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-contract-attendance.git

- Open the contract file in your IDE

<h1 align="center">Compile the contract:--</h1>

- Deploy the contract to your blockchain platform using your web3 provider

<h1 align="center">Usage:--</h1>

- The smart contract allows attendees to purchase food, clothes, funds, and other items from the vendor using cryptocurrency.
- The transaction is recorded on the blockchain, providing a secure and transparent record of the transaction.
- To use the smart contract, attendees must have a cryptocurrency wallet and access to the blockchain platform. 
- They can then send cryptocurrency to the vendor's address to purchase the item. Once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, the item is considered delivered.
